# 🏨 StayCatin: Hospitality Revenue & Occupancy Dashboard

### **Project Overview**
This project focuses on **Revenue Management** and **Inventory Optimization** for "StayCatin," a hospitality chain. Using **Tableau**, I transformed raw booking logs into an interactive storyboard that tracks key industry metrics like **Average Daily Rate (ADR)**, **Occupancy Rate**, and **Revenue Per Available Room (RevPAR)**.

The dashboard empowers property managers to identify seasonal demand spikes, analyze underperforming locations, and adjust pricing strategies to maximize profitability.

### **🎯 Key Business Problems Solved**
1.  **Pricing Strategy:** How does the **Average Daily Rate (ADR)** fluctuate across different hotel categories and seasons?
2.  **Occupancy Analysis:** Which locations suffer from low occupancy during weekdays vs. weekends?
3.  **Revenue Drivers:** Which booking platforms (Direct vs. OTA) contribute the highest revenue?
4.  **Loss Prevention:** Identifying properties with high cancellation rates to improve retention policies.

* **Advanced Visualization:**
    * **Dual-Axis Charts:** To compare ADR (Price) vs. Bookings (Volume).
    * **Heat Maps:** To visualize peak occupancy times by Day of Week and Hour.
    * **Geographic Maps:** To plot revenue distribution across different cities/states.
